# 🎯➡️ Arrows

**Arrows** is a challenging line-based puzzle game where players strategically activate animated lines to clear the playfield. Avoid collisions, manage your lives, and complete all levels.
Developed with **Unity**, the game features smooth animations, intelligent collision detection, and a robust, scalable architecture.

## 🎮 About the Game

Arrows is a line-based puzzle game where players activate lines by clicking on them.
Each line moves forward with an animation while gradually disappearing from its tail.

The core challenge lies in **timing your clicks correctly** to prevent collisions between lines.

* When two lines collide, you lose a life.
* Clear all lines to win the level.
